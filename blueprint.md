## Plan for a Slick New Window System

I'm about to give your app a major upgrade with a new windowing system inspired by your vision. Here’s the plan:

1.  **`Window.svelte` Component:** I'll start by creating a reusable Svelte component for the windows. It will have a sleek title bar, buttons to minimize, maximize, and close, and a flexible content area.
2.  **`windows.js` Store:** To keep everything organized, I'll set up a Svelte store. This will manage the state of all your windows, making it easy to add, remove, and update them as you work.
3.  **Drag-and-Drop:** I'll add intuitive drag-and-drop functionality so you can rearrange your windows however you like.
4.  **Animations:** Get ready for some eye-candy! I'll use Svelte's built-in transitions to create smooth, expressive animations for opening, closing, and moving windows.
5.  **Modern Look:** I'll polish the design with a dark, modern theme, clean lines, and a professional finish that matches your vision.

By the end of this, you'll have a windowing system that's not only functional but also a joy to use. Let's get started!
